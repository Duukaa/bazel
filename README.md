---

Bazel is a small, single-user web app you run on your own machine. It collects
the open pull requests of the repositories you watch, hands the ones you pick to
an AI agent, and shows you the review — the agents working live, the report
rendered, the cost in tokens. Nothing reaches GitHub unless you say so.

There are no subcommands: **the binary is the server**. Repositories, agents and
reviews are all managed from the page.

## Highlights

- **Agents are your own skills.** The agent list starts empty; you build it from
  the [Claude Code skills](#agents-are-your-skills) installed on your machine.
- **Reviews outlive the tab.** Each review is a server-side job. Close the
  browser, come back later, it's still there.
- **A terminal per agent.** A fleet of lenses running in parallel shows up as
  one live pane each, not as one scrambled stream.
- **You are the gate to the PR.** Read the review first; publishing is a
  separate, explicit action.
- **Token spend is reported** for every run — per agent in the log, and as a
  total when the review lands.

## How it works

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/flow.svg" alt="GitHub to the local bazel server, to a throwaway clone, to your agent, and back to you" width="940">
</div>

1. `gh pr view` brings in the metadata (title, author, branch, base, body).
2. The repository is cloned into a **throwaway directory** (`gh repo clone` with
   `--filter=blob:none` — full history, no blobs) and the PR is checked out.
3. Each agent of your choice runs **with that clone as its working directory**,
   receiving the prompt on stdin. A pipeline runs its agents one after another
   over the same clone — cloning once.
4. The clone is deleted at the end. `--keep` preserves it and the path shows up
   in the review footer.

A step that fails doesn't sink the review: it becomes a section with the error
and the rest carries on. Only when no agent returns anything does the whole
review fail.

Because the agent browses the checked-out code, the diff is **not** pasted into
the prompt — it is only downloaded if your template uses `{{diff}}`.

## Requirements

- Go 1.25+ (to build)
- [`gh`](https://cli.github.com), authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- `git`
- An AI agent on your `PATH` that reads a prompt on stdin — by default
  [`claude`](https://claude.com/claude-code) in [stream mode](#the-live-log),
  which is what feeds the live log
- The skills you want to use as review lenses, installed in `~/.claude/skills`

## Install

```sh
make install                      # builds into ~/.local/bin
make install PREFIX=/usr/local/bin
```

Or with Go:

```sh
go install github.com/beroni/bazel@latest
```

> The binary is called `bazel`, like Google's build tool. If you use both,
> rename one of them at install time (`-o ~/.local/bin/bz`).

## Quick start

```sh
bazel          # serves on 127.0.0.1:7777
bazel --open   # and opens the browser
```

On first run `~/.bazel/config.yaml` is created for you. Then, in the page:

1. Go to **config** and add a repository (`owner/repo`).
2. On the same page, turn one of your installed skills into an **agent**.
3. Back on the **dashboard**, tick a PR, pick the agent, hit **run**.

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--addr <host:port>` | where to listen (default `127.0.0.1:7777`) |
| `--jobs <n>` | concurrent reviews (default 2) |
| `--open` | open the browser |
| `--keep` | keep the throwaway PR clones |
| `--no-splash` | skip the opening animation |
| `--version` | version |

`--jobs` is what separates "reviewing two PRs" from "melting the laptop": every
review clones a repository and spawns an agent process.

## The web UI

A review takes minutes and no HTTP request survives that, so each one becomes a
**server-side job**. The browser gets an id immediately and the result arrives
over [SSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

From the page you can:

- **tick PRs** and choose **which agent** runs over them;
- **filter the list**: by text (title, repo or author), by ownership
  (`everyone` / `mine only`), by repository, and by review state —
  `not reviewed`, `✓ reviewed`, `⟳ changed since review`. With a filter on, the
  header counter becomes `12 of 92 PRs`. Filtering never unticks anything, but
  **review** only runs on what is currently visible;
- **collapse the list** — the `☰` button sits in the list itself and stays
  behind as a thin rail, so a review can take the full window; the choice is
  remembered in the browser;
- follow the queue, cancel a job, and watch the [live log](#the-live-log);
- **drop a job from the queue** with the `✕` on its card; if the review is
  still running it is cancelled along the way, and the saved markdown stays on
  disk either way;
- **read the rendered review** and decide whether it goes to the PR — inline
  comments or a plain comment, see [Publishing](#publishing-to-the-pr);
- re-read older reviews saved on disk — **and still publish them**, see below;
- add and remove watched repositories, and build your
  [agent list](#agents-are-your-skills) from the installed skills.

### What has been reviewed

Once a review finishes, the PR is **marked in the list** — and when it gets new
commits afterwards, the check turns into a warning:

```
#482  ✓ reviewed 2h · published
#479  ⟳ changed since review
```

The index lives in `<BAZEL_HOME>/reviews/.index.json`, keyed by the head commit
seen at review time.

## Agents are your skills

**An agent is one of your skills running over a PR.** That is why the list ships
empty: a factory list would only be right by accident, pointing at skills this
machine may never have had.

In **config**, the page lists what is actually installed — read from
`~/.claude/skills`, or from `skills_dir` in `config.yaml` — and every row turns
into an agent with one click:

```
installed skills · ~/.claude/skills
  /review-fleet     Runs a fleet of review lenses over one diff   [use] [⇧ publishes]
  /exploit-digger   Adversarial sweep of a diff                   [use] [⇧ publishes]
```

- **use** creates the agent `review-fleet`, with the task
  `/review-fleet {{number}}`: it hands the review back to you to read.
- **⇧ publishes** creates `review-fleet-post`, with `--post` and the prompt
  template that authorizes writing to GitHub — the page warns you before firing
  one of those.

The same skill can become both. In the list above each agent shows the skill it
calls, a **make default** button (the first one runs when you don't choose) and
**remove**:

```
review-fleet      default              ✓ /review-fleet
review-fleet-post ⇧ publishes          ✓ /review-fleet
serial-fleet      pipeline             ✓ /senior-code-reviewer  ✗ /exploit-digger
bazel-post-report used when publishing ✓ /bazel-post-report
```

The `✗` is the warning that matters: that agent calls a skill that is **not on
this machine** and would only fail at run time. Skills are usually symlinks into
the repository where you version them, and Bazel follows the links; the list is
read from disk every time you open the page, so installing a skill needs no
restart.

### The skill that ships inside Bazel

One entry in that list is marked **in Bazel** and is never `✗`:
`bazel-post-report`, the skill that takes a review you have read to the PR. It
travels inside the binary and is written into the PR's throwaway clone —
`.claude/skills/bazel-post-report/` — right before the agent runs, which is
where Claude Code looks for a project's skills. Nothing is installed on your
machine, and nothing is left behind when the clone goes.

This is what makes **publish** true on a machine that has never installed a
skill. Before it existed, the default `post_agent` called a `/post-report` that
only some machines had; everywhere else the agent ran with explicit permission
to write to the PR and no instructions at all.

Your own publishing skill still wins whenever you want it: point `post_agent.task`
at it, or build an agent out of it in the panel. A `post_agent` you have edited
is never rewritten — only the old untouched default is migrated to the built-in.

Everything the page does is written to `config.yaml`, and you can edit it by
hand for what the page doesn't offer — another model, another executable, your
own prompt template. See [Configuration](#configuration).

## The live log

The default args run the agent in stream mode:

```yaml
agent:
  command: claude
  args: [-p, --output-format, stream-json, --verbose, --allowedTools, "Read,Grep,Glob,Bash,Agent"]
  format: claude-stream
```

In that mode stdout is a stream of JSON events: Bazel turns each one into a
readable line (the tool called, and the argument that says what it is doing) and
takes the final report from the result event.

**Every line is signed by whoever wrote it.** A fleet spawns its lenses inside
the same process, in parallel; Bazel ties each `Task` call to the sub-agent it
created and stamps the lines coming out of it:

```
review-fleet          | → Agent(senior-code-reviewer): precision review
review-fleet          | → Agent(exploit-digger): adversarial sweep
exploit-digger        | → Grep exec.Command
senior-code-reviewer  | → Read internal/agent/agent.go
lazy-senior-dev       | 40 lines the stdlib already does
```

**Each agent gets its own terminal**, with its own name, line count and scroll —
a fleet becomes four panes side by side, its own and one per lens. Two lenses of
the same type in parallel become `exploit-digger` and `exploit-digger 2`, not
one muddle.

The log is a window over the last **500 lines** per review, held in memory. It
does not travel over SSE: the page remembers where it stopped and fetches only
what is missing, once a second. The agent's stderr is included, in another color.

`format` chooses how Bazel reads stdout: `claude-stream`, `codex-json`,
`grok-stream`, or `plain`. Leaving it out preserves the old behavior: arguments that ask for
Claude `stream-json` use the Claude adapter; all other commands use plain
stdout. Set it explicitly for Codex and other structured CLIs.

## Token usage

When an agent finishes, its last log line says what the run cost:

```
review-fleet          | ✓ done in 4m12s · 1,8M tokens · $2.41
```

**The count climbs while the agent works.** Every streamed message carries the
usage of the call behind it, so the queue card — and the review pane — show a
running total as it goes, marked with a `~`:

```
~412k tokens
```

The tilde is a promise that the number will grow: a partial count only sees the
agent's own conversation, and the lenses it spawned as sub-agents land at the
close. When the run finishes the closed tally replaces it — on the card, in the
footer of the report, and in the session total the top bar carries next to the
PR count:

```
1,8M tokens · $2.41 · 252s
```

That final number is the per-model tally of the last `stream-json` event —
input, output and cache added up, **sub-agents included**. The distinction
matters: the event's plain `usage` field covers only the main conversation, so a
fleet of three lenses would report a fraction of what it actually burned. In a
pipeline it is the sum of the steps. The same number goes into the header of the
saved markdown:

```
- Spend: 1,8M tokens (in 12k · out 84k · cache 1,7M) · $2.41
```

Plain agents report no spend. Codex JSON reports input, cached-input, and
output tokens; it does not currently provide dollar cost or quota information.
Grok Build's stream reports token usage and its final USD cost.

### Your Claude quota

The page also shows how much of your Claude allowance is gone — the same two
windows the `/usage` command reports:

```
claude session 86% · week 16%
```

It turns yellow at 75% and red at 90%, and the tooltip carries the reset times.

There is no command to ask for this, so Bazel doesn't ask: the number rides
along in the stream of whichever agent is running (`rate_limit_event`). What
you see is therefore the reading from the last agent that ran, and the tooltip
says when that was. A fresh server shows nothing until the first review.

## Where reviews go

Every review lands in three places, in this order:

1. **The page** — markdown rendered in the right-hand pane.
2. **A file** — `<BAZEL_HOME>/reviews/<repo>-<number>-<date>.md`, with the PR
   header, the agent that ran (per-step timings in a pipeline) and the
   [token spend](#token-usage). This is the copy that outlives the server: the
   **saved** tab reads it back and can still take it to the PR.
3. **The PR on GitHub** — only if you ask, and only after you have read it.

## Publishing to the PR

Three ways in, from the most deliberate to the most direct.

**1. Read, then publish** (the default). Run a review, read it on screen, then
click **publish inline review**. That runs the `post_agent` — the
`bazel-post-report` skill, which ships inside the binary — over a clone of the PR, with the markdown file you just read in the
prompt and the instruction **not to redo the review**: it publishes what is in
the file, with inline comments on the right lines, 👍 on what is already flagged
in the PR, and an all-clear when there is nothing to say. It runs **in the
review's own card** — the card goes back to running with the post agent's step
at the end of the list, log and all, and comes back to the review, now marked
`✓ published`, when it finishes. Publishing is the end of a review, not a second
job in the queue.

**2. Paste as a comment** ("or paste as a comment"). This is Bazel writing,
with no agent: the review markdown becomes a single comment, immediately. No
inline anchors, but no agent spend either.

**Leaving a false positive behind.** Every finding on screen — each `###`
under `## Findings` or `## Cuts`, or each `**1. …**` paragraph in reports that
number their findings in bold instead — carries a **report** checkbox, ticked
by default. Untick the ones you disagree with and they drop out of whatever you
publish next, on both paths above: the inline publish hands the post agent a
copy of the review without them (written to `publish/` inside the reviews
directory, the saved file stays whole), and the pasted comment simply omits
them. The line next to the buttons says how many go and how many stay, with
**all** / **none** shortcuts.

**3. Publish directly**, skipping your reading: pick an agent marked `⇧` in the
selector before reviewing — the one you created with **⇧ publishes**. It reviews
and publishes in the same pass.

None of this expires when the server does. The queue lives in memory, but every
review is on disk the moment it finishes, so one you read and did not publish is
waiting under **saved** — with the same two buttons, aimed at the PR named in
its header. Closing Bazel costs you the queue, not the review.

Agents in paths 1 and 3 carry their own prompt template: the default one forbids
writing to GitHub, and theirs replaces that with explicit authorization. Any
agent of yours can do the same with `posts: true`, which is what makes the UI
mark it with `⇧` and ask before firing — publishing is a write on someone else's
PR. And if you ask to comment over a review the agent already published, Bazel
warns you first.

## Configuration

The interface is two pages, switched from the top right and addressable by URL:
the **dashboard**, with the PRs, the queue and whatever you are reading, and
**config**. Switching does not reload anything — the event stream stays open and
a review in flight keeps its log — and reopening the tab at `#/config` comes
straight back to the configuration.

Everything the page changes — repos, agents, pipelines, the default — is written
to one file. The page no longer prints it at you: at the bottom there is **save
config.yaml**, which downloads it, and a collapsed *show the file* if you want to
read it. Dropping that file at the same path on another machine brings Bazel up
already configured.

`~/.bazel/config.yaml` (or `$BAZEL_HOME/config.yaml`):

```yaml
repos:
  - acme/api-core
  - acme/web-app

authors:          # filter by PR author; empty means everyone
  - beroni

include_drafts: false

reviews_dir: ""   # empty = <BAZEL_HOME>/reviews
max_diff_bytes: 400000   # only used if the prompt has {{diff}}
skills_dir: ""    # empty = ~/.claude/skills

# The base every named agent inherits from.
agent:
  command: claude
  args: [-p, --output-format, stream-json, --verbose, --allowedTools, "Read,Grep,Glob,Bash,Agent"]
  # Omit this to preserve legacy argument-based Claude detection.
  format: claude-stream
  checkout: true          # clone the repo and check the PR out first
  timeout_seconds: 1800
  prompt: |-
    {{task}}
    ...

# The lenses the selector offers. Starts empty — the page fills it from your
# installed skills. The first one is the default.
agents: []

# Sequences run over the same clone. Built in the page, under "config".
pipelines: []

# Who takes an already-read review to the PR.
post_agent:
  name: bazel-post-report
  task: /bazel-post-report {{review_file}}
  posts: true
```

### Agents and pipelines

An agent only declares **what changes**: its `task` goes into the `{{task}}` of
`agent.prompt`, and `command`, `args`, `format`, `checkout` and
`timeout_seconds` are inherited from the `agent` block when left out. `prompt`
replaces the whole template. `env` is extra process environment for that agent.
`args` inherit only with `command`; `format` inherits independently, so a custom
command should set its own format when the base uses a structured adapter.

```yaml
agents:
  - name: review-fleet
    description: three lenses, deduplicated into one verdict
    task: /review-fleet {{number}}
  - name: exploit-digger
    description: adversarial recall, class by class
    task: /exploit-digger {{number}}
  # This one publishes on its own: `posts` is what makes the UI warn first.
  - name: review-fleet-post
    task: /review-fleet {{number}} --post
    posts: true
  # A lens can run on another model, or another executable entirely.
  - name: quick-pass
    task: /senior-code-reviewer {{number}}
    args: ["-p", "--model", "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", "--allowedTools", "Read,Grep,Glob,Bash"]
    timeout_seconds: 600

pipelines:
  - name: serial-fleet
    description: the three lenses one at a time, each in its own process
    steps: [senior-code-reviewer, exploit-digger, lazy-senior-dev]
  # `pause` and `publish` are steps Bazel runs itself: read before it goes out.
  - name: read before sending
    steps: [review-fleet, pause, publish]

# Which choice runs when you don't pick one. Empty = the first in the selector.
default: serial-fleet
```

A **pipeline** chains agents by name, in order, over the same clone; the report
comes out with one section per step. A step pointing at an agent that doesn't
exist is skipped.

Two steps are not agents — Bazel runs them itself:

| Step | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pause` | Stops there. The clone stays up, the worker goes back to the queue, and the card waits with the report so far on screen and a **continue** button. |
| `publish` | Takes the report to the PR with the publishing agent — the same one the **publish inline review** button uses. Has to be the last step. |

That is what `review-fleet → pause → publish` is for: the fleet runs, you read
what it found, and only then does anything reach the PR. Continuing resumes
**inside the same clone** — cloning again would give you a different commit, and
the steps that already ran would be talking about another repository.

While a pipeline is paused it holds no worker: other reviews keep running. Give
up with **stop here** and what you read stays on screen; the clone goes.

You build one in the page rather than here: under **pipelines** on the config
page, drag a step out of the tray into the chain and drag the cards to reorder
them — clicking works the same, for when dragging is not worth it. Name it and
create. Only agents already in the list can be steps — that
is what guarantees each step arrives with its prompt, its command and its
publishing flag already settled. The same agent twice in one sequence is refused:
it would be the same work twice over the same clone. The rules around `pause` and
`publish` are enforced on the way in, not at run time: neither can open a
pipeline, a pause never follows a pause nor closes the sequence, `publish` runs
at most once and always last, and it needs something publishable before it.

`default:` names the choice that runs when you don't pick one. A pipeline can be
it — the selector lists agents before pipelines, so being first is not something
a pipeline could win by position. **make default** writes this field.

With no agents at all, the **review** button stays disabled and the page tells
you what is missing. If you wrote your own `agent.prompt` and have no `agents:`,
the selector shows a single choice — the bare `agent` block, which is how Bazel
behaved before the selector existed.

### Prompt placeholders

`{{task}}`, `{{repo}}`, `{{number}}`, `{{title}}`, `{{author}}`, `{{url}}`,
`{{branch}}`, `{{base}}`, `{{body}}`, `{{workdir}}`, `{{diff}}`.

`{{task}}` is the chosen agent's instruction — the only thing that changes from
one lens to the next. A template without `{{task}}` gets the instruction
prepended on the first line.

The `post_agent` gets two more: `{{review_file}}`, the path of the markdown you
read, and `{{review}}`, its text.

`{{diff}}` is the only one that costs an extra call to GitHub — if it isn't in
the template, the diff is never downloaded.

### Using another agent CLI

Anything that reads a prompt on **stdin** and writes markdown to **stdout**
works. With `checkout: true` it runs inside the PR clone, and whatever it writes
goes to the [live log](#the-live-log) line by line. Use `plain` when its stdout
is the report itself; use a named format when it has a supported event stream.

```yaml

  args: ["-p", "--model", "claude-opus-5", "--allowedTools", "Read,Grep,Glob,Bash,Agent"]
  format: claude-stream

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `BAZEL_HOME` | config directory (default `~/.bazel`) |
| `BAZEL_NO_SPLASH` | disables the opening animation |
| `NO_COLOR` / `CI` | also disable the animation |

## Security model

**Single-user by construction, and the port is local on purpose.** The server
uses the machine's already-authenticated `gh` — anyone who reaches it can make
it clone repositories and run an agent with `Bash` enabled. So it listens on
loopback, rejects a `Host` that isn't local (blocking DNS rebinding) and rejects
`POST` from another origin (blocking a random tab from firing reviews in your
name). Don't put this behind a public IP without authentication in front.

## Development

```sh
make          # build ./bazel
make run      # serve the web UI and open the browser
make check    # fmt + vet + test, before committing
make help     # every target
```

The front end (`internal/server/static/`) is embedded in the binary with
`go:embed` — no build step, no CDN: the page works offline.

Packages: `server` (HTTP, job queue, SSE), `agent` (runs the agents and
translates the stream), `config`, `gh` (talks to the `gh` CLI), `workspace` (the
throwaway clone), `store` (saved reviews and the reviewed index), `skills`
(discovers installed skills) and `splash` (the egg).
